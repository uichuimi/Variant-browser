# VariantBrowser

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.8.

## Steps for execute de code in a developer environment

If you do not have npm package manager, Node.js or any previous experience with Angular you will need to do some previous installations:

1. Node.js brings the npm package by default so access: https://nodejs.org/en/ to download it and install it.
2. Once installed you will need to install the Angular CLI, so with an open window terminal execute the following: npm install -g @angular/cli.

For future reference please visit the Angular "Getting started" site for a more detailed information in how to start working with an Angular project: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.

Once that you have all the resources mentioned above, you are ready to start up the project:

1. First clone/download the source code from this git repository into any folder of your liking.
2. With the CMD navigate to the folder where you downloaded the project.
3. Once you are on "/PROJECT-FOLDER/" (which is recognizable because you will see the "src" folder) execute: npm install. And wait a couple minutes depending on your machine.
4. Once the npm command finishes you can finally execute the project by using: ng serve. Once it finishes the compilation process just open your favorite browser (we recommend Chrome for this) and navigate to localhost:4000/. Enjoy the app!



## Code scaffolding
